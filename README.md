# Read LogFile using React, Redux and Material Ui

An application developed with React, redux and material ui. In this project we read Logfile periodically, its server call api is mocked and its data is generated in front side. It generate constant size of log rows and after sending all the rows, sending finished and no more call happened. 

## Run The Application

In order to build the project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node, you will also have NPM available to you. NPM is Node's
package manager which will resolve dependencies for you.

In the root of this repository, you can resolve all these dependencies via
the command line using:

    npm install
    
You can now start developing the application using Webpack. by typing:

    npm start

You can test Application using:

    npm run test
    
You can Beautify your code by typing:

    npm run format
    
You can Build the app for production to the `build` folder by typing:

    npm run build
    
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
